[Paul Annesley](http://paul.annesley.cc/)'s Zsh configuration.


Overview
--------

An extremely light-weight Zsh configuration framework.

All `~/.zsh/*.zsh` files are automatically sourced; see `rc.zsh` if you need to control the source order.


Instructions
------------

```sh
# grab the repo
git clone git://github.com/pda/dotzsh ~/.zsh

# symlink ~/.zshrc (will back up your old one)
~/.zsh/install
```
